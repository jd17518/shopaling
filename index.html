<!--Regardless of what type of site you make, you will need 5 pages for your website:

A homepage
        Contains a "mission statement" and made up background of your store. Have some fun. Be silly if you want. 
        Find an image that you think suits your store and put it front and center. This could be relevant to your store, or could be an "employee of the month"
        A navigation bar to the other pages of your site, and a header.
        A page for each category (3 total)
        Make sure the page has a header and some kind of marketing speak at the top, followed by your list of items to buy.    
On this page list at least 4 items your store sells in that category. Each item should be in its own div, section, or article, and each one should contain:
        Item name
        Image of item
        Description of item
        Price of item
        Don't forget to include a navigation bar to switch between sections of your site. 
        An order form page that contains:
        A table of all your items.
        The table should have the name of the item, a made up SKU, and a price for the item.
        A form that allows the creation of an order using the information you gave in the table.
        Style your pages after your "brand" that you made up. If you wanted to make an image in MS Paint for a logo, I would find that amusing. 
Have some fun with the project, but fulfill the requirements. -->
